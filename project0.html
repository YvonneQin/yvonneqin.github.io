            Challenge: "As clinical trials become increasingly complex, how can we enable personnel involved in the design of clinical trials to intuitively design and construct trials?" Simultaneously, established companies like Medidata, Veeva, Clinflash, and others have already formed substantial competitive advantages in the industry. Finding a foothold in this competitive landscape, shifting from data collection to database design to drive the growth of the product matrix, is the primary challenge that needs to be addressed.

          <p class="lead">
            Opportunity: We aim to provide standardization of processes for professionals in the clinical industry, particularly those who in Data Management (DM) and Database Designer (DBD). By employing multi-dimensional tool selection, we aim to lower the entry barriers for practitioners, starting from the lower end of the market, and address unresolved needs. The primary objective is to significantly reduce the development cycle of clinical trials, creating more value for Clinical Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and pharmaceutical companies while securing profit margins in the clinical industry.

          <p class="lead">
            Entering this industry, we realize that it is facing increasingly complex trial designs. The industry trend is moving towards simplifying Clinical Study Design through Computer-Aided Design (CAD). This shift is actively transforming the clinical industry towards digitization while complying with regulations. This appears to offer entry points for startup companies new to the industry.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            A growing number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and contract research organizations have taken steps to optimize their protocol designs in order to improve feasibility, ease site and subject participation burden, reduce the number of unplanned and unbudgeted protocol amendments, and gather more meaningfuI clinical data. These initiatives include protocol review committees, protocol-authoring practices connecting procedures to primary and key secondary end points, common protocol-authoring templates, and soliciting feedback on draft protocol designs frorm patients and investigative site staff before approval and execution.

            Therefore, the first Proof of Concept (POC) was born: Study Flow Builder. The concept is to link trial design with traditional product matrices and form design by selecting the trial methods, making the trial design clearer and more intuitive. For example, embedding the configuration of classical randomization schemes into the configuration process simplifies these complex experimental configurations, making them more straightforward, standardized, and less reliant on personal experience. This greatly streamlines the trial design process, reducing the threshold for trial design.

            This vision is very promising. We recognize industry trends, identify unresolved needs, and believe that, in the field of Computer Science, we excel at addressing such issues. While being a technology-driven startup, we currently lack the industry-specific knowledge and experience to quickly identify the best practice solutions for industry pain points. In the early stages of going from 0 to 1, we are re-immersing ourselves to continue finding the Product-Market Fit and establish a solid foundation for the product. Through multiple rounds of pitching with clients, we have adjusted our criteria for opportunities and alignment with clients: focusing on what startups excel at - driving industries with technology, meeting the immediate needs of existing clients, and addressing some of the unresolved needs with innovative solutions.

            In the existing process, a challenging aspect was the writing of logic. DBD aimed to ensure that data complied with trial logic by rapidly creating Edit Checks. However, for complex logic such as time window comparisons (checking if the time is within a 5-minute absolute value of the administration time, triggering an EDC query otherwise), Custom Function Scripts needed to be written. This increased the entry barrier for industry professionals and slowed down the trial implementation process.
